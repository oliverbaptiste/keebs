# Kinesis Freestyle Edge RGB

My first mechanical daily driver was the [Kinesis Freestyle RGB](https://gaming.kinesis-ergo.com/product/freestyle-edge/). While a very flexible, comfortable, and fun board, I never liked the bottom row layout with its non-standard 3.5u spacebars. Like many compact boards, it also lacked a third right modifier.
